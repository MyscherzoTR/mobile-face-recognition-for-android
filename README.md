## Örnek Çıktılar
Sample outputs of some celebrities are below.

1. As for the character control buttons, I added them at the last moment so that they can be played on mobile.
2. Normally, I wrote the code according to the computer keyboard to test the game comfortably.
3. I added the default buttons so finally that I can test it on android after certain things are done.
4. Necessary sprites will be added to these buttons in the near future. I needed to throw the project on Github, so it happened like this.

### Sample Level Climb Ladder
The climb button is normally deactivated. It becomes active when it comes to the relevant ladder. When the climb button is active, I deactivate the attack and jump buttons to avoid problems such as bugs.

When the work is done with the ladder, the climb button is deactivated again and the jump and attack buttons are active again.
